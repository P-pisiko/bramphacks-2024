# BrampHacks 2024 Community Event 
This is a hackathon event took place in the Brampton City Hall.
## Our Idea

- Collaborated with a team of 3 to develop an online survay application to alow people to give feadback to the city about the bike share system city might implement.
- We are aim to collect mass amout of data from the people doing the short survay which includes a place selected on the map, gender and age. We use data analysis and visualization to get the best possible location for the bike sharing.
